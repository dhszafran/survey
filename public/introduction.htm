    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h4>Please read the following text carefully.</h4>

    <br><br>
    You have been selected to participate in the Self-image Survey. This survey was created by Daria Szafran, a sociology student at the University of Mannheim. 
    Its primary goal is to collect data on social media use and body self-perception. 
    This data will allow for the exploration of correlations between the variables measured.
      <br><br>
      The survey is expected to take around 15 minutes to complete.

      <br><br>
      The survey is divided into three main sections: first, you will be asked general questions about your sociodemographics, 
      followed by questions about your leisure activities and social media use. 
      Finally, you will answer questions about your body self-perception.

      <br><br>
      Your participation in the survey is completely voluntary and you have the option to exit the survey at any time by closing your browser window. If you decide to participate, please finish the survey in one pass.
      <br>
      There are neither risks nor personal benefits arising from the participation. Nevertheless, by completing the survey, 
      you will make an important contribution to research. 
      The data collected will enable researchers to explore a variety of sociological questions and thus add to the current state of research. 
      Therefore it is essential that you answer the questions as honestly as possible.
      <br><br>
      Please note that you may press the "Back" button to navigate back in the survey, but your
      progress will be erased, and you will need to re-answer the questions as you step forward again.
      <br><br>
      Your data will be pseudonymised, which means that a personalised code will be assigned to your answers. After the data collection from all participants is completed, this code will be deleted.
      After deletion, it will not be possible to trace your answers back to your person.
      For this purpose, please fill in the short form at the end of this page.
